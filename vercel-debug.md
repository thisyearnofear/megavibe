# Vercel Deployment Debugging Guide

## Current Issue

Vercel is looking for `package.json` in `/vercel/path1/` instead of the repository root.

## Most Likely Cause

Your Vercel project settings have a "Root Directory" configured to a subdirectory.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Project Settings

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → General
4. Look for "Root Directory" setting
5. **Make sure it's empty or set to `.` (dot)**
6. If it shows anything else (like `path1`, `frontend`, etc.), clear it or set it to `.`

### 2. Alternative: Use Vercel CLI

If you have Vercel CLI installed, you can check and fix this:

```bash
# Link your project
vercel link

# Check current settings
vercel inspect

# Deploy with explicit root directory
vercel --cwd .
```

### 3. Alternative: Create New Vercel Project

If the above doesn't work:

1. Delete the current Vercel project
2. Create a new one
3. Make sure NOT to set any "Root Directory" during setup
4. Import your GitHub repository again

## Files We've Already Fixed

- ✅ `vercel.json` - Added proper build configuration
- ✅ `.vercelignore` - Removed `.next` from ignore list
- ✅ `next.config.js` - Removed `output: 'standalone'`

## Additional Checks

1. Ensure your repository doesn't have any `.vercel` directory committed
2. Check if there's a `vercel.json` in any subdirectory that might be confusing Vercel

## Environment Variables to Set in Vercel

Based on your `.env.example`, you'll need to set these in Vercel's Environment Variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
- `FILECOIN_PRIVATE_KEY` (for server-side)
- `VENICE_API_KEY` (for server-side)
- Any contract addresses you're actually using
