## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Smart Contract Design (Mantle Sepolia)**

```solidity
contract MegaVibeTipping {
    struct Tip {
        address tipper;
        address recipient;
        uint256 amount;
        string message;
        uint256 timestamp;
        string eventId;
        string speakerId;
    }
    
    // Ultra-low gas fees on Mantle
    function tipSpeaker(
        address recipient,
        string memory message,
        string memory eventId,
        string memory speakerId
    ) public payable {
        // 95% to speaker, 5% platform fee
        uint256 speakerAmount = msg.value * 95 / 100;
        uint256 platformFee = msg.value - speakerAmount;
        
        payable(recipient).transfer(speakerAmount);
        // Platform fee handling
        
        emit TipSent(msg.sender, recipient, msg.value, message, eventId, speakerId);
    }
}
```

### **Real-time Infrastructure**

**WebSocket Updates**:
```javascript
// Live tip feed updates
socket.on('newTip', (tipData) => {
  updateLiveFeed(tipData);
  showTipAnimation(tipData);
  updateSpeakerTotal(tipData.speakerId, tipData.amount);
});

// Speaker notifications
socket.on('tipReceived', (tipData) => {
  showSpeakerNotification(tipData);
  updateEarnings(tipData.amount);
});
```

### **Database Schema**

```javascript
// Tips Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  tipper: ObjectId(User),
  recipient: ObjectId(User), // Speaker
  event: ObjectId(Event),
  amount: Number, // USD amount
  amountMNT: Number, // Mantle amount
  message: String,
  txHash: String,
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'failed',
  timestamp: Date,
  isPublic: Boolean,
  socialShared: Boolean
}

// Live Feed Aggregation
{
  eventId: ObjectId,
  totalTips: Number,
  tipCount: Number,
  topTippers: [UserId],
  recentTips: [TipId],
  lastUpdated: Date
}
```
