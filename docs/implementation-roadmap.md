## Development Approach

### Sprint Structure

Each milestone will be developed in 1-week sprints, with the following structure:

1. **Sprint Planning**: Define specific tasks and assignments
2. **Daily Check-ins**: Brief updates on progress and blockers
3. **Mid-Sprint Review**: Assess progress and adjust as needed
4. **Sprint Demo**: Demonstrate completed functionality
5. **Retrospective**: Review what worked and what could be improved

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components and utilities
2. **Integration Tests**: For feature interactions
3. **Visual Regression Tests**: For UI components
4. **End-to-End Tests**: For critical user flows
5. **Performance Tests**: For optimization verification

### Quality Gates

Before completing each milestone, the following quality gates must be passed:

1. **Code Quality**: All linting and TypeScript checks pass
2. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for critical paths
3. **Performance Budget**: Load time < 3s on 3G, FCP < 1.5s
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance
5. **Cross-Browser**: Works on latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Technical Debt Management

To avoid accumulating technical debt:

1. **Refactoring Budget**: 10% of each sprint dedicated to refactoring
2. **Documentation Requirements**: All components must be documented
3. **Code Reviews**: Required for all PRs with a focus on maintainability
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Regular checks against performance baselines

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **FilCDN Integration Complexity**: May require more time than estimated

   - Mitigation: Begin with simplified mock implementation

2. **Animation Performance**: Complex animations may perform poorly on mobile

   - Mitigation: Test early on low-end devices, simplify if needed

3. **Scope Creep**: Features may expand beyond initial estimates

   - Mitigation: Strict milestone reviews and scope management

4. **Design Feedback Cycles**: Design iterations may delay development
   - Mitigation: Use parallel tracks for design and development

## Next Steps

1. Create initial project structure
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement proof of concept for The Stage
4. Begin development of core components

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All milestones are completed
2. The application meets performance requirements
3. User testing shows improved usability over the current implementation
4. The codebase is maintainable and well-documented
5. FilCDN integration is robust and reliable
