# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture and Decentralization - MegaVibe

## üåê Overview of Web3-Native Architecture

MegaVibe is built on a **Web3-native architecture**, prioritizing decentralization, censorship resistance, and alignment with blockchain principles. This approach eliminates traditional backend dependencies, reduces hosting costs, and ensures scalability through direct interactions with smart contracts, social identity protocols, and decentralized storage solutions.

### Architecture Decision: Web3-Native vs Hybrid

- **Chosen Approach: Pure Web3-Native** (Recommended for simplicity and alignment with Web3 principles)
  ```
  Frontend ‚Üí Smart Contracts (Mantle)
          ‚Üí Neynar API (Farcaster)
          ‚Üí Static Data (IPFS/CDN)
  ```
- **Benefits**:

  - True decentralization and censorship resistance.
  - Simplified architecture with fewer moving parts.
  - Lower costs by eliminating backend hosting.
  - Scalable through blockchain and CDN infrastructure.

- **Alternative Considered: Hybrid with Bridge**
  ```
  Frontend ‚Üí Smart Contracts + Neynar API (Primary)
          ‚Üí Backend + MongoDB (Fallback/Admin)
  ```
  - Benefits include fallback during API outages and admin tools for manual curation, but adds complexity.

### Current Implementation Status

- **Farcaster Integration (Complete)**:
  - Live Neynar API for real Farcaster profiles.
  - Speaker discovery by username or wallet address.
  - Rich profiles with follower counts, bios, power badges, and verifications.
  - Web3 Speaker Cards for enhanced UI with social and on-chain data.
  - Talent page (`/talent`) for full discovery interface.
- **Smart Contract Integration**:
  - Tipping Contract: `0xa226c82f1b6983aBb7287Cd4d83C2aEC802A183F`
  - Bounty Contract: `0xf6D9428094bD1EF3427c8f0bBce6A4068B900b5F`
  - Cross-platform flow: Discover ‚Üí Tip ‚Üí Bounty ‚Üí Track Impact.

### Core Services Architecture

- **Data Sources Priority**:
  1. **Smart Contracts (Mantle)**: Tips, bounties, reputation.
  2. **Neynar API (Farcaster)**: Social profiles, verification.
  3. **Static Data (CDN/IPFS)**: Events, venues, metadata.
- **Key Components**:
  - `web3SocialService.ts`: Neynar integration for profile fetching.
  - `contractService.ts`: On-chain interactions and reputation scoring.
  - `Web3SpeakerCard`: Rich profile display with social and on-chain data.
