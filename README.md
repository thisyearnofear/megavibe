# MegaVibe MVP

## Overview

MegaVibe is a web application that allows users to interact with live music, rate songs, follow artists, set bounties, set tips and more.

## Problems

FOR AUDIENCE: Shazam handles music discovery for recorded audio, there is NO solution for LIVE. Artists (at open mics and such) have terrible conversion of people enjoying their music turning into subscribers/followers/etc

Current UX: "follow my instagram @pewdiepie1000_f3" (not many do)
Future UX: push a button when you feel a MEGAvibe, bam, there I am. Convenience.

FOR MUSICIANS: we get lots of metrics with our recorded stuff, but don't have many around our live performances. Its mostly gut/feel. Honest feedback mechanisms lacking.

Megavibe emoji scores offer a path to testing new music and seeing how it lands, experimenting with different versions of songs, an NPS score for the LIVE experience.

FOR HOSTS: the open mic is under monetized. People randomly come in and play of different quality, experience, and genre's. Controlling the flow of an event means matching the artist who can play HAPPY BIRTHDAY (for a small bounty perhaps) with the big birthday group coming later, or automatically connecting artists present (based on their history/profile) who all know how to play the same Jazz Standard "Autumn Leaves" to rock a big finale & mid-section. To mix covers with originals perhaps even.

Megavibe will help match users that are attending or planning to attend with their favourite genres, artists, or songs being played live to maximise enjoyment of the experience.
